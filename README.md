# GitOps Pipeline Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for setting up a GitOps pipeline using Argo CD and Argo Rollouts! This guide will walk you through the process of automating the deployment and management of a simple web application in a Kubernetes environment. Whether you're a technical expert or new to these concepts, this documentation aims to provide clear and understandable instructions.

Click here to see the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/deepanshurawat6/flask-frontend/general) of the application. Also here is the follow up [argo-configs](https://github.com/deepanshu-rawat6/flask-frontend-configs) repository.

## 1. Setup and Configuration <a name="setup-and-configuration"></a>

### 1.1 Create a Git Repository

To get started, we create a GitHub repository to host the source code of our web application. This is where we'll store all the files needed for deployment.

### 1.2 Install Argo CD

Argo CD is a tool that helps us manage our Kubernetes applications using Git repositories. We follow the instructions in the official documentation to install and configure Argo CD on our Kubernetes cluster. This allows us to automate deployments based on changes to our Git repository.

### 1.3 Install Argo Rollouts

Argo Rollouts is an extension of Argo CD that allows for advanced deployment strategies, such as canary releases. We install the Argo Rollouts controller in our Kubernetes cluster by following the provided guide.

## 2. Creating the GitOps Pipeline <a name="creating-the-gitops-pipeline"></a>

### 2.1 Dockerize the Application

We containerize our web application using Docker, which allows us to package the application and its dependencies into a single unit. This makes it easier to deploy and manage our application in Kubernetes.

### 2.2 Deploy the Application Using Argo CD

With our application containerized, we modify the Kubernetes manifests in our Git repository to use the Docker image. We configure Argo CD to monitor our repository for changes and automatically deploy the application to our Kubernetes cluster.

## 3. Implementing a Canary Release with Argo Rollouts <a name="implementing-a-canary-release-with-argo-rollouts"></a>

### 3.1 Define a Rollout Strategy

Argo Rollouts allows us to implement advanced deployment strategies, such as canary releases. We modify our application's deployment to use Argo Rollouts and define a canary release strategy in the rollout definition. This includes specifying the number of replicas and the percentage of traffic to be routed to the canary release.

### 3.2 Trigger a Rollout

When we're ready to deploy a new version of our application, we make the necessary changes, such as updating the Docker image. We push the new version to our container registry and update the rollout definition to use the new image. Argo Rollouts then handles the deployment process, gradually shifting traffic to the new version according to our defined strategy.

### 3.3 Monitor the Rollout

Throughout the rollout process, we use Argo Rollouts to monitor the deployment of the new version. We can track metrics and analyze user feedback to ensure that the canary release completes successfully without impacting our users.

## 4. Documentation and Cleanup <a name="documentation-and-cleanup"></a>

### 4.1 Document the Process

To wrap up, we document the entire process, including any challenges we encountered and how we resolved them. This documentation is essential for both technical and non-technical users to understand how the GitOps pipeline works and how to maintain it in the future.

### 4.2 Clean Up

Finally, we provide instructions on how to clean up all the resources created during the assignment from our Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that we don't incur any unnecessary costs and that our cluster remains clean and organized.

## Conclusion

Setting up a GitOps pipeline using Argo CD and Argo Rollouts allows us to automate the deployment and management of our applications in Kubernetes. By following these steps, we can streamline our development process, improve deployment reliability, and deliver features to our users more efficiently. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to Kubernetes, this documentation should help you get started with GitOps practices.
